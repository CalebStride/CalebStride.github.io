<p>A lot of these pages are pretty short and don't go into much detail as it would take a lot of time to do, and it would probably be boring to read.</p>
<p>Some of the projects remain private on GitHub so not all of them will have the code available.</p>
<p>NOTE: A lot of these projects are done to help develope and practice my skills. I know a lot of the projects I've worked on already have solutions (probably better than mine) but I see this as good practice either way.</p>
