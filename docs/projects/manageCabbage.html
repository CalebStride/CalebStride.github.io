<p>Manage Cabbage is a personal spending management web application created by me (Caleb). It&#39;s main purpose is to record spending and to give insights into where money has been spent.</p>

<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve always liked to keep on top of my personal finances. Although finding an easy way to do so is hard. For a couple of years I used spreadsheets to keep track of all my spending. This was pretty messy and only really held basic information for transactions (how much and what day). So I decided to put my free time to good use and create a website to store and manage this data instead.</p>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<p>When I started designing and coding the website I didn&#39;t really have that much web experience and was freshly out of university. So I decided to start using what I currently knew a bit about, which was php. You can read about the first design <a href="manageCabbage/manageCabbageOld.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>After a while the website seemed like it was in need of an upgrade. It didn&#39;t help that the whole of the backend was written in php (a language I knew little about). So I decided to start looking at more up-to-date technologies and how I could better utilise my Java experience. You can read about that process here.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="can-i-use-it">Can I use it?</h3>
<p>Not currently. Maybe in the future but at the moment I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable for other people to use it as I would be liable for their data.</p>
<h3 id="why-dont-you-just-use-one-of-the-many-existing-applications">Why don&#39;t you just use one of the many existing applications?</h3>
<p>Because this way I know my data is secure. Even though I&#39;m pretty sure banks just sell your transaction info to third parties anyway.</p>
<h3 id="will-you-integrate-your-website-to-pick-up-transactions-externally">Will you integrate your website to pick up transactions externally?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s been something I&#39;ve thought about. It definitely makes sense to have it as an option so you don&#39;t have to manually enter each payment.</p>
<h3 id="whats-with-the-name">What&#39;s with the name?</h3>
<p>I was trying to think of a name for the website when buying a domain to host it. One of my friends suggested this and it just kind of stuck.</p>
